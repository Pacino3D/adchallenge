<li>The content might not be completely the same as in design. Don't mind about it, use the one that is in the provided database. Just make sure it looks the same as in design.</li>
<li>Header should be styled in a way that when you scroll down it sticks to the top of the page and is visible all of the time. Clicking on links in the main navigation should take you to the appropriate section on the homepage using “smooth scroll” animation. When the page is scrolled to this section, the correct link must be highlighted (active link).</li>
